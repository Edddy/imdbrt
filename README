The root directory contains various images that probably aren't required anymore. The item directory contains the actual extension code.

To create the release ZIP:

  zip item item/*

To update the source script, download one of the install links from http://userscripts-mirror.org/scripts/show/12897 to item/12897.js. The current site may not have the older versions so save link as on the 'Install' button. Diff the saved file with the base and restore any relevant changes.
