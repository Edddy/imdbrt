The root directory contains various images that probably aren't required anymore. The item directory contains the actual extension code.

To create the release ZIP:

  zip item item/*

To update the source script, download one of the install links from http://userscripts.org:8080/scripts/versions/12897 to item/12897.js. Patch the API key if necessary.
